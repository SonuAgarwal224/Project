During the libraries, there are chances of errors related to ggplot, so for that I install the ggplot packages.
also, I changed two things in the anaconda files for updatin the libraries:

1. Changed in stats/smoothers.py
anaconda3/Lib/site-packages/ggplot/stats

**remove lib
from pandas.lib import Timestamp
Change to
from pandas import Timestamp

**if needed, remove tslib:

date_types = (
    pd.tslib.Timestamp,
to
date_types = (
    pd.Timestamp,


2.changed in anaconda3/Lib/site-packages/ggplot/utils.py

**add underscore in second line before tslib

date_types = (
    pd._tslib.Timestamp,
    pd.DatetimeIndex,
    pd.Period,
    pd.PeriodIndex,
    datetime.datetime,
    datetime.time
